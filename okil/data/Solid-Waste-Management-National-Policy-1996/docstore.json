Preamble:  \nAs the volume of solid waste has increased together with the density of population, \nurbanization and industrialization it has been diversified in its nature also. Particularly this \nproblem has found emerged in municipal corporation, municipalities and town  oriented \nvillages. It is desirable to have cooperation in local level of every citizen, group of people, \nindustrial group and non -governmental organizations for the minimization of adverse \neffect of solid waste in environment and public health, having mad e its proper \nmanagement.  \n  As there is no proper statistics about the nature, volume, collection \ntransportation and final disposal of different types of solid wastes generated in city area, \nthree is not yet developed a concept of proper sanitation. Since there is lack of proper \nmanagement of solid wastes, this problem is remained static as there is no growth of public \nawareness about the adverse effect in public health and environment as well as effort of \nthe people for its control. This problem is being c omplex by the disposal system of \ndifferent types of harmful wastes and other domestic wastes to be mobilized into any \nresources. Hence in this context, a national policy is formulated relating to the \nmanagement of solid wastes.  \n2. Objectives:  \n2.1 To make man agement work of the solid wastes simple and     \n effective.  \n 2.2  To minimize environmental pollution caused by the solid wastes and  \n  adverse effect thereof  to the public health.  \n 2.3  To mobilize the solid wastes as resources.  \n 2.4  To privatize the management work of the solid wastes.  \n 2.5  To obtain public support by increasing public awareness in the  \n  sanitation works.  \n3.
