As is now widely recognized , \nlack of access to these essential basic services contributes s ubstantially to the high burden of \ndisease that needlessly foreshortens and impairs the lives of far too many of Nepal\u2019s citizens.  \n \nThe economic costs of ill health, medical treatment, lost time and opportunities caused by \nlack of access to these basic services accounts for an estimated cost in South Asia of around \n$34 billion11.
