This Forestry Sector Policy and \nits programmes  together determine the institutional arrangement and the legislative package for \nthe sector.  \n \nAlthough Nepal has a long tradition of formulating policies, it has never instituted a system of \nperiodically amending or updating these policies. The present of ficials in the ministry are entrusted \nwith the task of making the policy of the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation compatible \nwith the responsibilities of the ministry. Consequently, after assuming office, I felt the need for \nreviewing and updating the existing policy to make it more relevant and up -to-date.  \n \nThe Forestry Sector Policy, 2000, is an updated version of the Forestry Master Plan Policy and \nsubsequent amendments to that document. It should inspire the revision of the documents of the \nMast er Plan for the Forestry Sector as well. The policy of 2000 contains development imperatives, \noutlines, strategies, and programmes, and summarises the investment required to develop the \nforestry sector. The policy will be instrumental in helping the govern ment to prepare plans and \nprogrammes, to formulate legislation and to develop a mechanism that fosters co -operation with \ndonor agencies. In sum, issuance of this policy will ensure that the forestry sector plays a vital role \nin the overall progress and wel l-being of Nepal and her people.  \n \nThe following Forestry Sector Policy, 2000, reflects the noble wishes of His Majesty's Government \nand, in my view, is a valuable asset of the Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation.  \n \nI would like to thank all the professionals involved for their valuable inputs in preparing this \ndocument.  \n \nSeptember 2000.  \n------------------  \nPrime Minster", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 1955, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3bc2eaa-fd63-4f87-b36c-2add023d22b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3bc2eaa-fd63-4f87-b36c-2add023d22b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Forestry-Sector-Policy-2000.pdf", "file_path": "data/Forestry-Sector-Policy-2000.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 726043, "creation_date": "2024-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-06"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d5b3cda-0b8b-4027-8766-f7be307bd945", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Forestry-Sector-Policy-2000.pdf", "file_path": "data/Forestry-Sector-Policy-2000.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 726043, "creation_date": "2024-05-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-06"}, "hash": "4d4f7d308eacfd5511db53d6a5b2e3a79f565aecb23deced7f39b3eba1efb0df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "www.lawcommission.gov.np  \n3 \n Forestry Sector Policy, 2000  \n \n \n1. Heavy Pressure on Forests  \nThe increasing population is exerting heavy pressure on t he forests of Nepal. The people \ndepend on forests for firewood as well as for timber, medicinal plants and other forestry \nproducts. They also use forests to graze livestock and to collect fodder, to feed the large \nnumber of livestock raised to supply the m anure essential for agricultural crops. As a result \nof this pressure, the area of forests has been reduced and the number of trees depleted. Thus, \nit has become increasingly difficult for the people to meet their basic need for forestry \nproducts. Pressure on the remaining healthy forests has consequently intensified, thus \ncreating a vicious cycle and aggravating the already serious problems of environmental \ndegradation and declining agricultural productivity.  \n \nTable 1 Projected Supply and Demand of Forest P roducts without the Master Plan1  \n  2000 -01 2010 -11 \nFuel wood  Supply  12.1 15.5 \n Demand  15.2 16.9 \n(millions of tones)  Balance  -3.1 -1.4 \nTimber  Supply  1.4 2.2 \n Demand  2.5 3.3 \n(millions of cubic meters)  Balance  -1.1 -1.1 \nFodder  Supply  7.4 8.3 \n Demand  7.2 8.5 \n(millions of tonnes)  Balance  +0.2 -0.2 \nForest area which will be degraded to meet the    \ndemand (thousand of hectares)   741.3  1464.6  \n    \n \nTable 1 shows that the forestry programs planned previously, if carried out successfully, will \nincrease the supply of forestry products, but that the demand will grow even faster because \nof the increasing population.

As a result, legislation, which included several major acts and  \ntheir associated rules, was not in accordance with the spirit of the new forestry sector \npolicy, which was arrived at through the master planning process. This discrepancy \nwas particularly noticeable in the case of community forestry. Policy is now very \nclearly oriented toward \"people's participation\" in contrast to previous legislation such \nas the Forest Act of 1961, which originally aimed to prevent (the villagers) from \nentering forests.
